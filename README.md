#SablePP

A C# compiler development toolbox, built using SableCC.
At its core SablePP provides generalized functionalities for developing formal languages/compilers.
This includes features for providing syntax highlighting (only tested on .NET platforms), a simple-to-use construct for compiler errors that are linked to the erroneous code and generalized implementations for handling scope.

Additional information about the project is available at http://sablepp.deaddog.dk/.
